# PineappleSSL
A way to force your pineapple to use SSL

You have a Wi-Fi Pineapple and want to harness all its power yet everytime you are logging into it this is done over http. Your username and passwords are being sent unencrypted over the network so the wrong people could get access to it. I will show you how to change this so all the network traffic is encrypted.
